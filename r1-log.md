## Log

### R1D1 
Started an Image Repository (Pexels for African images). Worked on the project initialization and layout of the app.

### R1D2
I had to restart the project...I figured I made a mistake somewhere in my steps. FIxed now...nitialization and layout of the app.

### R1D3
I connected my app to heroku for and configured autodeployments.


### R1D4
I added gallery migrations and models and started with the controllers. 

### R1D5
I actually missed day five but I'm trying to cover up by working double shifts...I think I'll still add the extra day at the end though.
