# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 02, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: initialized my project and created a repository for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with figuring out the approach [packages or modules] to take since this is somewhat still new to me, but I managed to figure out some basic things and so I'm sticking with modular approach.
